# Authentication

## Description

Authentication is a **secure backend application** developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, designed to handle user authentication and access control. It allows users to **register**, **log in**, **secure their credentials**, and **access protected routes**. The system supports **hashed passwords** and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** or **session-based** authentication methods, making it adaptable for different security needs.

This backend service can be easily integrated into full-stack applications to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data or actions.

## Features

- 🔐 User registration with encrypted passwords
- 🔓 Secure login with validation
- 🛡️ Access control via JWT/session tokens
- 🚫 Logout functionality
- ✅ Environment-based configuration with dotenv
- 📁 Modular code structure for scalability

## Tech Stack

### **Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Bcrypt (for password hashing)
- JSON Web Token (JWT)
- Express-Session (optional alternative to JWT)
- Dotenv
- CORS
- Nodemon (for development)

## Getting Started

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication.git
   cd authentication
Acknowledgments
This project was created as a part of backend authentication practice using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It incorporates essential security concepts such as password hashing, token generation, and access protection to serve as a reliable boilerplate for future secure applications.
